PirateAudio Hat with Pico2-W
============================

![](./webradio-piraudio.jpg)

The PirateAudio hat from Pimoroni is originally made for a Pi with a
standard 2x20 header meant to be directly plugged into a Pi or
Zero. With an [adapter](https://github.com/bablokb/pcb-pico-pi-base)
it can also be used together with a Pico:

The hat has a 240x240 ST7789-display and four buttons. It is available
in various variants, e.g. with a speaker, headphone connector or line-out.

It is a perfect fit for this webradio-project, since it needs no additional
components.

Software support is in `src/hw_config_piraudio.py`.
